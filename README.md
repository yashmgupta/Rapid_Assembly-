# Rapid Assembly of Mitochondrial Genes from Public Transcriptome Data

## ðŸ”¬ About

This repository contains the complete bioinformatics pipeline and dataset for assembling mitochondrial genes, particularly cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1), directly from public transcriptomic data. The methodology bypasses traditional wet-lab procedures, providing a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative for obtaining complete mitochondrial gene sequences.
